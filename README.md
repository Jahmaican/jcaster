This is basically the simplest [Lode's Raycaster](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) rewritten to Ruby (gosu, texplay). Helped me to understand the raycasting technique. I'm going to optimize the code and maybe turn it into an actual game some time.  
  
**Controls:**  
WSAD to move  
Mouse to look around  
Esc to exit.
